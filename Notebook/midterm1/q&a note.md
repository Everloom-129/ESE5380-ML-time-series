## Time Series as Stochastic Processes: A Study Guide

### Short Answer Quiz

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.

1. **What is a stochastic process, and how does it relate to time series data?**

   > A stochastic process is a collection of random variables indexed by time. Time series data can be viewed as a realization or sample path of an underlying stochastic process, allowing for probabilistic analysis and forecasting.

2. **Define weak-sense stationarity (WSS) and its key properties.**

   > Weak-sense stationarity (WSS) requires a constant mean and a time-invariant autocovariance that depends only on the lag between observations. This implies that the process's first and second moments are stable over time.

3. **Describe the concept of autocorrelation and its importance in time series analysis.**

   > Autocorrelation measures the linear relationship between a time series and its lagged values. It helps identify recurring patterns, dependencies, and the degree of predictability within the data.

4. **What are the main differences between strong-sense stationarity (SSS) and weak-sense stationarity (WSS)?**

   > SSS requires that the joint distribution of any collection of variables remains invariant under time shifts, while WSS only requires time-invariance for the mean and autocovariance. SSS is a stronger condition than WSS.

5. **Explain the concept of a Markov process and its relevance to time series modeling.**

   > A Markov process is a stochastic process where the future state depends only on the present state, not on the entire past history. This memoryless property simplifies modeling by capturing dependencies within a limited time window.

6. **How does the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test help in determining the stationarity of a time series?**

   > The ADF test examines the presence of a unit root in a time series. A unit root indicates non-stationarity. The test helps determine whether differencing or other transformations are necessary to achieve stationarity.

7. **What are the advantages of decomposing a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components?**

   > Decomposition separates a time series into its underlying components, allowing for better understanding and modeling of each element individually. This can improve forecasting accuracy and provide insights into the driving forces behind the series.

8. **Explain the concept of partial autocorrelation function (PACF) and its relation to the autocorrelation function (ACF).**

   > PACF measures the correlation between two points in a time series after removing the influence of intermediate lags. Unlike ACF, which considers all intermediate lags, PACF isolates the direct relationship between observations separated by a specific lag.

9. **Define heteroskedasticity and discuss its potential impact on time series analysis.**

   > Heteroskedasticity refers to the non-constant variance of the error terms in a time series model. This violates the assumption of homoskedasticity, potentially leading to biased and inefficient parameter estimates

10. **What is Granger causality, and how is it different from true causality?**

    > Granger causality assesses the predictive power of one time series on another. If past values of series A improve the prediction of series B, then A Granger-causes B. It does not necessarily imply a direct causal link but indicates a predictive relationship.





### Essay Questions

1. **Discuss the importance of stationarity in time series analysis and forecasting. Explain the implications of non-stationarity and describe different methods for achieving stationarity.**
2. **Explain the concept of temporal dependencies in time series data. How are these dependencies captured and modeled in different time series analysis techniques?**
3. **Compare and contrast the model-based and data-driven approaches to time series forecasting. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and provide examples of techniques used in each.**
4. **Discuss the application of machine learning techniques in time series forecasting. What are the key challenges and considerations when applying machine learning to temporal data?**
5. **Describe different deep learning architectures used for time series forecasting, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformers. Explain the strengths and limitations of each architecture.**

Term Definition

- **Stochastic Process:** A collection of random variables indexed by time. Time series data can be considered a realization of a stochastic process.

- Stationarity: A statistical property of a time series where the statistical properties remain constant over time.

- Strong-Sense Stationarity (SSS): A strong form of stationarity where the joint distribution of any collection of variables remains invariant under time shifts.
- Weak-Sense Stationarity (WSS): A weaker form of stationarity where the mean and autocovariance are time-invariant.
- Autocorrelation Function (ACF): A function that measures the linear correlation between a time series and its lagged values.

- Markov Process: A stochastic process where the future state depends only on the present state, not on the entire past history.
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test: A statistical test to check the stationarity of a time series by examining the presence of a unit root.
