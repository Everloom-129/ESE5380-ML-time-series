**Problem Statement Recap:**

We are given a two-dimensional VAR(1) process defined by:

\[
\mathbf{Y}_k = A \mathbf{Y}_{k-1} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_k,
\]

where:

- \(\mathbf{Y}_k = \begin{bmatrix} Y^1_k \\ Y^2_k \end{bmatrix}\),
- \(A = \begin{bmatrix} \phi_{11} & 0 \\ \phi_{21} & \phi_{22} \end{bmatrix}\),
- \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_k = \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon^1_k \\ \epsilon^2_k \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, I_2)\),
- \(\epsilon^1_k\) and \(\epsilon^2_k\) are independent random variables from \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\).
